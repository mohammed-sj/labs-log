# *2025-11-06* **Git Fundamentals & Local Workflow**

### What I practiced
- Understanding key Git concepts: repo, commit, branch, remote, HEAD, etc.
- Exploring directory internals and how Git tracks history.
- Using core commands  to manage versions.
- Learning the 3 Git areas: working directory, staging area and repository.
- Tracing Git history. 

### Cheatsheet
- `git init` | Create a new repository in current folder
- `git add <FILE>` | Stage files for the next commit
- `git commit -m "message"` | Save staged snapshot with a message
- `git status` | Show changes and what’s staged or unstaged
- `git log --oneline --graph` | View commit history visually
- `git diff` | See changes since last commit
- `git diff --staged` | Compare staged files to last commit
- `git show <COMMIT>` | Display what happened in a specific commit
- `git blame <FILE>` | Show who last modified each line
- `git reflog` | Show all HEAD movements (even deleted branches)

### Key outcome
Built a solid understanding of how Git tracks changes through snapshots and hashes, and how commits move from working directory to staging area to repository.
