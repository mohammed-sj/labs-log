## *2025-09-25* â€” Linux file and directory basics

**What I practiced:**
- How to handle nested directories
- How to read files more efficiently
- How to combine files
- Copying, moving and deleting files and folders

**Commands (cheatsheet):**
- `cat file1 file2 > newfile` | combine files into new file
- `head -n N file` | show first N lines of a file 
- `tail -n N file` | show last N lines of a file
- `cp file1 file1copy` | copy file and give it a new name
- `cp file1 file2 /dir` | copy multiple files to directory
- `cp -r dir1 /dir` | copy directory and its contents (recursively) into another directory
- `mv file1 /dir` | move file to directory
- `mv old new` | rename a file
- `mkdir -p dir1/dir2` | make nested directories
- `rm -r dir` | remove directory and its contents

**Why it matters:**
The more commands I know, the more confident I get in the terminal. Being able to handle files and folders quickly from the terminal makes it possible to do real work later (like scripting or setting up servers) without depending on a GUI.

**Next step:**
- Finish the remainder of the Linux module
