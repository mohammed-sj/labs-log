## *2025-09-21* â€” **Kickoff: Portfolio structure & Git basics** 

**What I practiced:**
- Set up the structure for my DevOps portfolio on GitHub
- Made the first repos i need to get started
- Used basic git commands to get content into GitHub

**Why it matters:**
- It gave me a solid starting point, a place to track my progress and keep everything organized.
- Got a bit more familiar with basic git commands which I will be needing through out this journey

**Commands (*cheatsheet*):**  
git clone <url> | copies repos from GitHub locally
git add . | Stages all changes to commit
git commit -m "message" | Save a snapshot of work locally with a message
git push -u origin main |  Uploads commit to GitHub

**Key outcome:**
- The framework for how I will track my progress is now set and I have something solid build on.

**Next step:**
- Work through Linux fundementals hands-on
