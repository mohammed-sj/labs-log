## *2025-09-21* â€” **Kickoff: Portfolio structure & Git basics** 

**What I practiced:**
- Set up the structure for my DevOps portfolio on GitHub
- Made the first repos i need to get started
- Used basic git commands to get content into GitHub

**Why it matters:**
- It gave me a solid starting point, a place to track my progress and keep everything organized.
- Got a bit more familiar with basic git commands which I will be needing through out this journey

**Commands (*cheatsheet*):**  
- `git clone <url>` | copies repos from GitHub locally
- `git add .` | stages all changes to commit
- `git commit -m "message"` | save a snapshot of work locally with a message
- `git push -u origin main` |  uploads commit to GitHub
- `git revert HEAD` | makes a new commit that undoes the last one
- `git reset --hard HEAD~#` | goes back to desired commit while deleting all newer commits

**Key outcome:**
- The framework for how I will track my progress is now set and I have something solid build on.

**Next step:**
- Work through Linux fundementals hands-on
