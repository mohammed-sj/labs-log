## **Linux navigation & filesystem - practice and theory**

**Key outcome:**
- Practiced core navigation and file manipulation in the Linux terminal.
- Navigated the filesystem and managed files without the help of a GUI.
- Gained an understanding of the theory behind the linux file system and how commands work.

**Commands (*cheatsheet*):** 
- `man <command>` | opens manual page for a command
- `<command> --help` | quick overview of options for a command 
- `pwd` | shows current directory (print working directory)  
- `ls` | lists contents of current directory (`-a` shows hidden files)  
- `cd <directorypath>` | moves into given directory
- `touch <filename>` | creates a new file  
- `mkdir <dirname>` | creates a directory  
- `rmdir <dirname>` | removes an empty directory  
- `rm <filename>` | removes a file
- `echo "Hello World" > file.txt` | writes text to file.txt (overwrites)  
- `echo "Hello World" >> file.txt` | appends text to file.txt  
- `cat file.txt` | displays contents of file.txt  
- `grep "Hello" file.txt` | searches for "Hello" inside file.txt

**Why it matters:**
- Understanding what’s happening under the hood helps when troubleshooting or fixing issues.
- Getting familiar with navigation commands is essential since they’re everyday tools for a DevOps engineer.

**Next step:**
- Continue with the Linux fundamentals module.
